# Traditional Database

Database:
- Types:
  - Relational
    - SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL
  - Non-Relational
    - MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Couchbase
- Collection of tables or documents
  - Tables:
    - Primary Keys (ID)
    - Records: Data within rows of table
  - Mongo
    - Database = Database
    - Collection = Table
    - Documents = Records
      - stored as JSON
    - Is a **Document Data Store**

# MERN Stack
- M: Mongo
- E: Express
- R: React
- N: Node

# Express
- Need a `package.json` file
  - run `npm init` or `npm init -y`
- Install Dependencies:
  - Express: ` npm i express`
  - Mongoose: `npm i mongoose`
    - package that connects to MongoDB
  - dotenv: `npm i dotenv`
  - **NOTE:**
    - We can install multiple dependencies at once
    - `npm i express mongoose dotenv`
- Entry point within `package.json`
  - `index.js` || `app.js`
- `.gitignore`
  - ignore files / folders that shouldn't be in our github repo
    - ex: node_modules & .env

# .env
- Contains constants that are specific for our environment.
- Stores items that we don't want published.
  - passwords / port numbers / deployment routes / keys
- Should be added to `.gitignore`
- Should have a sample version to communicate with team.
  - `example.env`

## Mongo & Mongoose
- Needs to connect to our database
  - Using **MongoDB Compass**
  - Stateful connection

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const MONGO = process.env.MONGODB;

mongoose.connect(`${MONGO}/moviedb`);

const db = mongoose.connection;

db.once("open", () => log(`Connected: ${MONGO}`));
```

# Models 
- Define what our database collection will look like.
  - A schema for each object being created.
  - `mongoose` establishes our schema.

Example: 
```js
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    firstName: {
        type: String,
        required: true 
    }
})
```

## Challenge:
```js
/*
! CHALLENGE:
    - Add a boilerplate code for the controller
    - Create a POST method route ('/signup')
    - Make sure route is working
        - simple response of "Connected"
        -Test in Postman
    - full URL is:
        - localhost:4000/user/signup
*/
```

## Bcrypt
`npm i bcrypt`
- dependency that handles encryption of data
  - mostly common for passwords (but not limited)

### Encryption
- Plain text passwords are not secure when stored within the database.
  - Allows another layer of security for both users and the application.
  - If the database never knows it, less desired to "hack".

## Hashing
- An algorithm to change plain text into various characters.
  - transformed as a **one-way value**.
  - practically impossible to turn hashed value back to original string.
- Encrypted prior to storing to DB
- No matter length of string (password), hash value is the same length.
  - Like strings will result in the same hashed output.
    - **needs `salting`**

## Salting
- includes random strings within the plain text being hashed.
- Makes for upredictability for the hashed value.
- We can denote the number of "salts"
  - Good value is 10-13 iterations.

example:
```js
bcrypt.hashSync("abc", 10);
```
- first param = string (password)
- second param = number of times the password will be salted (randomized)

## JWT / JSON Web Token
- `npm i jsonwebtoken`
- A way for our server to authenticate the user.

example code:
```js
const token = jwt.sign({id: user._id}, "secret message", {expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24});
```
- `sign(payload,message,options)`
- 3 arguements:
  - payload
    - In the sample we are using an object that details the id of the user.
  - encrypt/decrypt message
    - passed in as a string in this sample
    - Typically store as a variable in the `.env`
  - options (expiration)
    - represents seconds or a string time span
      - ex: `2 days` or `10h`

## Challenge:
```js
/* 
! Challenge
    - Create a Schema called MovieSchema
    - Properties within:
        "title": string, required
        "genre": string
        "rating": string, required
        "length": number, required
        "releaseYear": number
    - Create a new controller called `movie.controller.js`
      - boilerplate the controller (no routes are needed right now)
      - consider the file/folder structure.
    - Connect the controller to the application (app.js)
    - Connect the MovieSchema to the controller.
        
    Note:
        Consider how the User model was created.
