# Traditional Database

Database:
- Types:
  - Relational
    - SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL
  - Non-Relational
    - MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Couchbase
- Collection of tables or documents
  - Tables:
    - Primary Keys (ID)
    - Records: Data within rows of table
  - Mongo
    - Database = Database
    - Collection = Table
    - Documents = Records
      - stored as JSON
    - Is a **Document Data Store**

# MERN Stack
- M: Mongo
- E: Express
- R: React
- N: Node

# Express
- Need a `package.json` file
  - run `npm init` or `npm init -y`
- Install Dependencies:
  - Express: ` npm i express`
  - Mongoose: `npm i mongoose`
    - package that connects to MongoDB
  - dotenv: `npm i dotenv`
  - **NOTE:**
    - We can install multiple dependencies at once
    - `npm i express mongoose dotenv`
- Entry point within `package.json`
  - `index.js` || `app.js`
- `.gitignore`
  - ignore files / folders that shouldn't be in our github repo
    - ex: node_modules & .env

# .env
- Contains constants that are specific for our environment.
- Stores items that we don't want published.
  - passwords / port numbers / deployment routes / keys
- Should be added to `.gitignore`
- Should have a sample version to communicate with team.
  - `example.env`

## Mongo & Mongoose
- Needs to connect to our database
  - Using **MongoDB Compass**
  - Stateful connection

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const MONGO = process.env.MONGODB;

mongoose.connect(`${MONGO}/moviedb`);

const db = mongoose.connection;

db.once("open", () => log(`Connected: ${MONGO}`));
```

# Models 
- Define what our database collection will look like.
  - A schema for each object being created.
  - `mongoose` establishes our schema.

Example: 
```js
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    firstName: {
        type: String,
        required: true 
    }
})
```

## Challenge:
```js
/*
! CHALLENGE:
    - Add a boilerplate code for the controller
    - Create a POST method route ('/signup')
    - Make sure route is working
        - simple response of "Connected"
        -Test in Postman
    - full URL is:
        - localhost:4000/user/signup
*/
```
